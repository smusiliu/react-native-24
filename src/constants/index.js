## Calculus

The derivative of a function 'f(x)' is given by:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This represents the rate of change of the function at a given point.

## Trigonometry

The Pythagorean identity in trigonometry is given by:

$$
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
$$

This identity is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem and is fundamental to many areas of mathematics.
